This is a prototype implementation for a policy service provider using Automated Policy Management (APM) outlined in this paper (link).

This implementation is there to 1) illustrate how APM works, 2) provide a suggested workflow of APM with respect to the policy provider.

We used Flask for simplicity but using an async framework like FastAPI is suggested since APM requires asynchronous API calls.
